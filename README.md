How to run locally
Just Curious utilizes a proprietary API as for its database, so all that is needed to run locally is the repo and npm install:
•	download the zip file from here
•	unzip the file to your desired location OR
•	clone this repo via your CLI of choice at your desired location
•	navigate to the location of the unziped/cloned repo in your CLI of choice
•	cd into that directory
•	run npm install
•	once the install is complete, run npm run start and the project should open up in your default browser
